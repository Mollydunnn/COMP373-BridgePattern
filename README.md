# COMP373-BridgePattern
This is Nida Hameed and Molly Dunn's implementation of an example of the Bridge pattern. We implement an interface (Bakery.java) as the implementor, with two classes (Bake.java, and Decorate.java) as concrete implementors. We then used the Pastry.java class as the abstraction, and the two classes, Cookie.java and Cake.java, for refined abstraction. 
To Run: Open and run the Driver.java file in the view package.
